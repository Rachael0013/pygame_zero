# Game description
"shoot a apple" game is easy game. In this game when we click the apple it says "Good shoot" but in the other hand when we missed it says "Bad shoot" and quit the game and shows the score. While you click the apple, the 1 point which is score will go up. Also the apple appear randomly at the game-screen. When you click the apple it will appear somewhere else. We need to click a apple correctly unless you will get a low score.
